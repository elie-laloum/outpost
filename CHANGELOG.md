# Changelog

## 1.1.1

- Separate Claude and Codex adapters, request builders and protocol decoders; preserve unknown events as raw observations.
- Split sandbox provisioning, operation ownership, dispatch, attachment, conversation storage and recovery into dedicated services.
- Separate campaign planning, issue execution and integration; isolate workflow state, retries and scheduling.
- Isolate container planning, mounts, commands and transfers, cloud command/file adapters, Git worktree management and remote synchronization stages.
- Extract contracts into `.types.ts` modules and configuration defaults into `.constants.ts` modules, without changing public entry points.
- Enforce dependency boundaries and type placement in CI, reject unused implementation declarations, and document the structure in English and French.

- Expose per-turn transcripts, custom conversation stores, selective path rewriting and separate Claude cache counters.

- Recover managed workspaces, refresh reusable branches and preserve host edits during committed-only remote synchronization.
- Complete Podman namespace options, macOS preflight, file-mount preparation and bounded transfers.
- Add human progress reporting, appendable journals, recovery metadata and terminal cleanup.
- Expand functional, provider and package tests; document migration in English and French.
